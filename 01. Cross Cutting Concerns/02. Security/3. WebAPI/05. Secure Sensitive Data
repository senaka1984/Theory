5. Secure Sensitive Data
Avoid Hardcoding Secrets
•	Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, connection strings) in environment variables or a secure vault like Azure Key Vault.
Example: Using Environment Variables:

var connectionString = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("DB_CONNECTION_STRING");


Encrypt Sensitive Data
•	Use encryption to protect sensitive data at rest and in transit.
