1. Use Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Service-to-Service Communication

Mutual TLS ensures that both the client and server authenticate each other during communication.
How to Implement mTLS in Kubernetes:
1.	Generate Certificates:
•	Use tools like OpenSSL or cert-manager to generate certificates for each microservice.
2.	Distribute Certificates:
•	Store certificates securely in Kubernetes Secrets.
3.	Configure Services:
•	Configure each microservice to use the certificates for mutual authentication.
4.	Use a Service Mesh:
•	Tools like Istio, Linkerd, or Consul simplify mTLS setup by automatically managing certificates and encryption.

Example: Using Istio for mTLS
•	Install Istio in your Kubernetes cluster.
•	Enable mTLS for a namespace:

apiVersion: "security.istio.io/v1beta1"
kind: "PeerAuthentication"
metadata:
  name: "default"
  namespace: "your-namespace"
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
