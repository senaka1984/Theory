2. Use Network Policies

Kubernetes Network Policies control traffic between pods and namespaces, ensuring that only authorized services can communicate.
Example: Allow Traffic Only Between Specific Pods

apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-specific-traffic
  namespace: your-namespace
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: service-a
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: service-b
