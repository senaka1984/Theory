3. AWS SQS/SNS Security

a. Use IAM Policies for Access Control
•	Grant only the necessary permissions to users, roles, or services.
•	Use resource-based policies to restrict who can send/receive messages.
Example IAM Policy:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "sqs:SendMessage",
        "sqs:ReceiveMessage"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:sqs:us-east-1:123456789012:MyQueue"
    }
  ]
}


b. Use Server-Side Encryption (SSE)
•	Enable SSE for SQS and SNS to encrypt messages at rest using AWS KMS.
c. Use HTTPS Endpoints
•	Always connect to SQS/SNS using HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.
Example:

var sqsClient = new AmazonSQSClient(new AmazonSQSConfig
{
    ServiceURL = "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com"
});


d. VPC Endpoints
•	Use VPC endpoints to keep traffic between your VPC and SQS/SNS private.
