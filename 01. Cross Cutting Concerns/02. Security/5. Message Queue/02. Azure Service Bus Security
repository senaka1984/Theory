2. Azure Service Bus Security


a. Use Azure Active Directory (AAD) Authentication
•	Prefer AAD over shared access keys for authentication.
•	Assign least-privilege roles (e.g., Azure Service Bus Data Sender, Azure Service Bus Data Receiver).
Example:

var client = new ServiceBusClient(
    "your-servicebus-namespace.servicebus.windows.net",
    new DefaultAzureCredential());


b. Use Shared Access Signatures (SAS) Carefully
•	If using SAS, use short-lived tokens and restrict permissions (send, listen, manage).
c. Encrypt Data in Transit
•	Azure Service Bus uses TLS by default for all connections.
d. Encrypt Data at Rest
•	Data is encrypted at rest by default in Azure Service Bus.
e. Network Security
•	Use Private Endpoints or Service Endpoints to restrict access to your Service Bus namespace.
•	Use IP firewall rules to allow only trusted IPs.
