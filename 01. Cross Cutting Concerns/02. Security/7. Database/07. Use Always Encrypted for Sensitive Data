7. Use Always Encrypted for Sensitive Data

â€¢	Use Always Encrypted to protect sensitive data (e.g., credit card numbers, SSNs) at the column level. The encryption keys are stored securely, and the data is encrypted/decrypted transparently.
Steps:
1.	Enable Always Encrypted in SQL Server.
2.	Configure the encryption keys.
3.	Update your connection string to include Column Encryption Setting=Enabled.

Example Connection String:

"Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;Trusted_Connection=True;Encrypt=True;Column Encryption Setting=Enabled;"
