Use X-Frame-Options
•	Set the X-Frame-Options header to DENY or SAMEORIGIN in your backend to prevent your app from being embedded in an iframe.
Example:
X-Frame-Options: DENY;


Use CSP Frame-Ancestors
•	Use the frame-ancestors directive in your Content-Security-Policy header to control which domains can embed your app.
Example:
Content-Security-Policy: frame-ancestors 'self';
