8. Use Indexes in the Database
•	Ensure your database tables have appropriate indexes for frequently queried columns.
---
9. Minimize Database Calls
•	Avoid multiple round-trips by combining queries or using .ToListAsync() only when needed.
---
10. Use Connection Pooling
•	Connection pooling is enabled by default, but ensure your connection string and environment do not disable it.
---

11. Cache Frequently Used Data
•	Use in-memory caching (e.g., IMemoryCache) for data that doesn’t change often.
---
12. Profile and Monitor Queries
•	Use tools like EF Core logging, SQL Profiler, or Application Insights to identify slow queries and optimize them.
---

13. Use No-Tracking with Identity Resolution (EF Core 5+)
•	If you need no-tracking but want to avoid duplicate entities in the result, use .AsNoTrackingWithIdentityResolution().
---
14. Avoid Lazy Loading in High-Performance Scenarios
•	Prefer explicit loading or eager loading with .Include() to avoid unexpected extra queries.
---

15. Use Split Queries for Large Includes (EF Core 5+)
•	For queries with multiple includes, use .AsSplitQuery() to avoid Cartesian explosion.
Example:

var blogs = await dbContext.Blogs
    .Include(b => b.Posts)
    .AsSplitQuery()
    .ToListAsync();
