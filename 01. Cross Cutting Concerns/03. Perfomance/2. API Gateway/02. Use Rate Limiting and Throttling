2. Use Rate Limiting and Throttling

•	Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage by limiting requests per user or subscription.
•	This protects backend services from spikes and DoS attacks.
Example (Azure APIM Policy):

<rate-limit-by-key calls="100" renewal-period="60" counter-key="@(context.Subscription.Id)" />
