General AWS Security Questions
------------------------------

1.	What is IAM in AWS?
•	IAM (Identity and Access Management) is a service that enables you to manage access to AWS resources securely by creating users, groups, and roles with specific permissions.

2.	What is the principle of least privilege?
•	Granting only the permissions necessary for users or services to perform their required tasks—nothing more.

3.	How do you secure data at rest in AWS?
•	Use encryption services like AWS KMS, enable encryption for S3 buckets, EBS volumes, RDS, and DynamoDB.

4.	How do you secure data in transit in AWS?
•	Use SSL/TLS for all communications, including S3, API Gateway, and ELB endpoints.

5.	What is a security group?
•	A virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control inbound and outbound traffic.

6.	What is a NACL (Network Access Control List)?
•	An optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a stateless firewall for controlling traffic in and out of subnets.

Serverless and Application Security
-----------------------------------
7.	How do you secure AWS Lambda functions?
•	Assign least-privilege IAM roles, encrypt environment variables, use VPC for private resources, and store secrets in AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store.

8.	How do you secure API Gateway endpoints?
•	Use IAM authentication, Cognito user pools, Lambda authorizers, enable throttling, and use AWS WAF for protection.

9.	How do you manage secrets in AWS?
•	Use AWS Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store to store, rotate, and manage secrets securely.

10.	What is AWS KMS and how is it used?
•	AWS Key Management Service (KMS) is used to create and manage cryptographic keys for encrypting data at rest and in transit.

Monitoring and Compliance
------------------------
11.	How do you monitor AWS resources for security events?
•	Use AWS CloudTrail for API auditing, CloudWatch for logs and alarms, and AWS Config for resource compliance.

12.	What is AWS GuardDuty?
•	A threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior.

13.	How do you ensure compliance in AWS?
•	Use AWS Config, AWS Artifact, and AWS Security Hub to monitor, audit, and report on compliance.

Scenario-Based Questions
-------------------------
14.	How would you restrict access to an S3 bucket?
•	Use bucket policies, IAM policies, and block public access settings. Enable server-side encryption.

15.	How do you protect against DDoS attacks in AWS?
•	Use AWS Shield, AWS WAF, and enable rate limiting on API Gateway.

16.	How do you secure communication between microservices in AWS?
•	Use VPC, security groups, private subnets, mTLS, and IAM roles for service-to-service authentication.

17.	What steps would you take if you detected a compromised IAM key?
•	Immediately deactivate or delete the key, investigate CloudTrail logs, rotate credentials, and review permissions.



Best Practices
--------------

18.	What are some AWS security best practices?
•	Enable MFA, use least privilege, rotate credentials, encrypt data, monitor with CloudTrail, and regularly audit resources.

19.	How do you implement least privilege for Lambda functions?
•	Assign each function an IAM role with only the permissions it needs, and nothing more.

20.	How do you secure access to RDS databases?
•	Use VPC security groups, enable encryption, use IAM authentication (where supported), and restrict public access.
