🟢 Beginner Level – Foundations
📘 1. DevOps Fundamentals
What is DevOps? History, culture, and goals

DevOps vs Agile vs CI/CD

DevOps lifecycle: Plan → Develop → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor

Benefits of DevOps: faster delivery, reliability, collaboration

⚙️ 2. Source Control Management
Git basics: clone, commit, push, pull, merge

Branching strategies: GitFlow, trunk-based development

Platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket

🧪 3. Continuous Integration (CI) Basics
Definition and goals of CI

CI tools: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI

Running unit tests, linters, and formatting checks on commits

📦 4. Build Tools
Language-specific: Maven/Gradle (Java), MSBuild (C#), npm (JavaScript)

Docker basics: containers vs VMs, images, registries

☁️ 5. Cloud and Infrastructure Basics
IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

Intro to AWS, Azure, GCP

Regions, availability zones, virtual machines

🟡 Intermediate Level – Automation & Scalability
🛠️ 6. Configuration Management
Tools: Ansible, Chef, Puppet

Idempotency, playbooks, inventory files

Automating OS/package/configuration setup

🔁 7. Continuous Deployment (CD)
Blue/Green Deployments

Canary Releases

Rolling updates

Tools: Spinnaker, ArgoCD, GitHub Actions with environments

📦 8. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Tools: Terraform, Pulumi, AWS CloudFormation

Concepts: declarative vs imperative, modules, state management

Best practices: modularization, versioning, secrets handling

🐳 9. Containerization & Orchestration
Docker: volumes, networking, Docker Compose

Kubernetes (K8s): pods, services, deployments, namespaces

Helm: templating Kubernetes deployments

🔎 10. Monitoring & Logging
Metrics vs Logs vs Traces

Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK/EFK stack, Fluentd, Loki

Application Performance Monitoring (APM): Dynatrace, Datadog, New Relic

📈 11. Security Practices (DevSecOps)
Secrets management: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager

SAST/DAST tools: SonarQube, OWASP ZAP

Vulnerability scanning: Trivy, Snyk, Aqua

🔴 Advanced Level – Scalability, Reliability, and Strategy
🧠 12. Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)
Error budgets, SLIs, SLAs, SLOs

Incident response and blameless postmortems

Chaos engineering tools: Gremlin, Chaos Mesh

🔁 13. Advanced CI/CD Strategies
Pipelines as Code: YAML definitions

Matrix builds, caching, parallel jobs

Cross-environment deployment validation (staging, QA, UAT, prod)

📊 14. Cost and Performance Optimization
Right-sizing infrastructure

Autoscaling strategies (HPA in K8s)

Cost monitoring: AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management

🔐 15. Policy as Code & Compliance
Tools: Open Policy Agent (OPA), Conftest

Use in Kubernetes (Gatekeeper), Terraform (Sentinel)

Auditing and compliance reporting

🌍 16. Multi-cloud and Hybrid Strategies
Vendor lock-in risks and avoidance

Multi-cloud orchestration tools: Crossplane, Anthos

Hybrid CI/CD pipelines

⚡ 17. Platform Engineering & Internal Developer Platforms (IDP)
Developer self-service platforms

Backstage.io, Internal Developer Portals

Golden paths and templates

📚 Suggested Study Path (Beginner to Expert)
Learn Git + CI/CD

Understand Docker → Compose → Kubernetes

Implement IaC with Terraform

Build pipelines (Jenkins/GitHub Actions/GitLab CI)

Add monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)

Secure your pipelines (DevSecOps)

Deploy multi-service app with K8s + Helm + GitOps

Optimize with SRE concepts and autoscaling

Build an internal developer platform

📦 Real-World Use Cases
✅ Microservices deployment with Kubernetes & Helm

✅ Auto-scaling web apps with metrics-based triggers

✅ Secure CI/CD for fintech or healthcare apps

✅ IaC for provisioning complete environments

✅ Self-healing systems with chaos testing
