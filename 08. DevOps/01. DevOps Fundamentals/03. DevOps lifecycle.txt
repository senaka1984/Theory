Plan → Develop → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor


🔄 DevOps Lifecycle: Overview

	DevOps is a continuous cycle that spans planning, coding, deploying, operating, and monitoring software systems — automating and optimizing every stage.

🔁 Phases:
	Plan → Develop → Build → Test → Release → Deploy → Operate → Monitor → (Back to Plan)

	🔹 1. Plan
		Goal: Define business requirements, user stories, features, and release timelines.

			📌 Practices:
	
				Agile planning (Scrum, Kanban)
	
				Backlog grooming
	
				Sprint planning
	
			📌 Tools:
	
				Jira, Azure Boards, Trello, Confluence, Notion

	🔹 2. Develop
		Goal: Write code collaboratively, with version control and coding standards.

			📌 Practices:

				Pair programming, code reviews
				
				Branching strategies (e.g., GitFlow)
				
				Unit testing and static code analysis
				
			📌 Tools:
				
				Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
				
				IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ)
				
				SonarQube, ESLint

	🔹 3. Build
		Goal: Compile code, resolve dependencies, and create build artifacts.

			📌 Practices:
			
				Automated builds triggered by commits
			
				Artifact versioning
			
				Packaging and containerization
			
			📌 Tools:
			
				Maven, Gradle, MSBuild
			
				Docker, JFrog Artifactory, Nexus

	🔹 4. Test
		Goal: Validate quality and functionality of the software.
			
			📌 Practices:
			
				Unit, integration, and UI testing
				
				Load and security testing
				
				Shift-left testing (early testing)
			
			📌 Tools:
			
				Selenium, JUnit, NUnit, Postman
				
				Cypress, JMeter, OWASP ZAP
				
				GitHub Actions/Test, GitLab CI

🔹 5. Release
		Goal: Approve and schedule a production-ready version.

			📌 Practices:
			
				Release tagging and approvals
			
				Change management & rollback plans
			
			📌 Tools:
			
				Git tags, Azure DevOps Release Pipelines
			
				ServiceNow (for approvals), LaunchDarkly (feature flags)

🔹 6. Deploy
		Goal: Deliver the release to production or staging environments.

			📌 Practices:
			
				Blue/Green, Canary, or Rolling deployments
			
				Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
			
				GitOps deployment model
			
			📌 Tools:
			
				Kubernetes, Helm, Terraform
			
				Jenkins, ArgoCD, Spinnaker, Octopus Deploy

🔹 7. Operate
	Goal: Run and support the application in production reliably.

			📌 Practices:
			
				Observability (metrics, logs, traces)
			
				Capacity management
			
				Incident response, alerting
			
			📌 Tools:
			
				Kubernetes/Docker Swarm, AWS ECS/EKS
			
				Systemd, Supervisor, PM2

🔹 8. Monitor
	Goal: Track performance, errors, and user behavior; enable feedback loops.

			📌 Practices:
			
				Real-time monitoring and alerting
			
				SLO/SLI/SLAs
			
				Feedback to planning and development teams
			
			📌 Tools:
			
				Prometheus + Grafana, ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
			
				Datadog, Dynatrace, New Relic
			
				Sentry, AppDynamics

🔁 Continuous Feedback Loop
			Each phase provides feedback to earlier stages:
			
			Monitoring insights → feed into planning.
			
			Test failures → improve development.
			
			Deployment metrics → enhance build/release strategies.
