📘 1. What is Agile?

	Agile is a software development methodology that emphasizes:

		🖊 Iterative development through short cycles called sprints

		🖊 Customer collaboration

		🖊 Adaptive planning and fast feedback

	🧩 Agile solves: How to build the right software faster, incorporating feedback continuously.


⚙️ 2. What is DevOps?

	DevOps is a culture and set of practices that brings together:

		🖊 Development + Operations + QA + Security

		🖊 Automation of infrastructure and workflows

		🖊 Monitoring and continuous feedback

	🧩 DevOps solves: How to deliver and run software reliably, at scale, with fewer barriers between teams.
	
🔁 3. What is CI/CD?

	CI/CD stands for:

		🖊 CI (Continuous Integration): Automatically building and testing code on each commit

		🖊 CD (Continuous Delivery)   : Automatically preparing code for release

		🖊 CD (Continuous Deployment) : Automatically pushing code to production

	🧩 CI/CD solves: How to automate and speed up software delivery, reduce errors, and support rapid iteration.
	
	
🎯 How They Work Together

	Agile helps you build the right product through iteration and feedback.

	DevOps ensures that you can deliver that product quickly and reliably.

	CI/CD is the toolchain and automation layer that enables DevOps goals.
	
	
📊 Real-World Analogy

	Agile is like designing a new car with frequent user feedback.
	
	DevOps is setting up the factory, assembly line, and maintenance to deliver and support that car.
	
	CI/CD is the robotic system on the factory floor that builds and ships the car with precision.
