 Lifting state up in React is a technique used to move the shared state to the closest common ancestor of components that need to access or modify that state.
 It enables better coordination and data flow between components.
 
 
 ðŸ”§ Why Lift State Up? 
 
	When two or more sibling components need to share and modify the same data, keeping state in each of them individually leads to inconsistency. 
	Instead, lift the state to their parent and pass it down via props.
	
ðŸ“Š Example: Without Lifting State Up
	
	function TemperatureInput() {
	
	const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState('');
		return (
			<input
				value={temperature}
			onChange={e => setTemperature(e.target.value)}
			/>
	);
	}
	
	This works alone, but if another component also needs the same state, theyâ€™ll diverge.
	
	
	
âœ… With Lifting State Up

	function TemperatureInput({ temperature, onTemperatureChange }) {
		return (
			<input
				value={temperature}
				onChange={e => onTemperatureChange(e.target.value)}
			/>
		);
	}

	function ParentComponent() {
		const [temperature, setTemperature] = useState('');

		return (
			<>
				<TemperatureInput
					temperature={temperature}
					onTemperatureChange={setTemperature}
			/>
			<p>The temperature is {temperature}Â°</p>
    </>
  );
}

Sibling communication becomes easy

Predictable data flow (top-down)

Improves maintainability
