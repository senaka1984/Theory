Vite — a modern build tool and development environment for frontend applications.

🚀 What is Vite?

	Vite (pronounced veet, French for "fast") is a lightning-fast build tool and development server created by Evan You (the creator of Vue.js), 
	but it works with React, Svelte, Vue, Vanilla JS, and more.

🔧 Why Vite Instead of Webpack or CRA?

| Feature                 | Create React App / Webpack        | Vite                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Dev Server Startup Time | ❌ Slower (bundles first)          | ✅ Instant (via native ESM)          |
| Hot Module Replacement  | ⚠️ Sometimes slow, re-bundles     | ✅ Super fast HMR                    |
| Build Speed             | ⚠️ Can be slow for large projects | ✅ Much faster with esbuild & Rollup |
| Config Complexity       | ❌ Often complex or hidden         | ✅ Minimal, yet flexible             |
| Native TypeScript       | 🟡 Works but config-heavy         | ✅ First-class support               |



🛠️ Core Vite Features

	Instant server start – using native ES modules in the browser

	Fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement) – updates UI in milliseconds

	Optimized production build – using Rollup under the hood

	TypeScript support

	Plugin ecosystem – extend with vite-plugin-*

	Framework agnostic – React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, Lit, etc.


🧪 Vite React App Setup

1. Create a Vite project

npm create vite@latest my-app --template react

  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 3000,
  },
});


🧠 Real-World Use Cases

SPA apps (React/Vue)

Design systems

Component libraries

Prototyping UIs rapidly
