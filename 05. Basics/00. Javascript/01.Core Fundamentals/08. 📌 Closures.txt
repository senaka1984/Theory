A JavaScript closure is a powerful feature that allows a function to “remember” the scope in which it was created — even after that scope has finished executing.

🔍 Definition:
		A closure is a function that has access to its own scope, the outer function’s scope, and the global scope, even after the outer function has returned.

🧠 Why Are Closures Important?

	Closures allow:

		🖊 Data privacy (like private variables)

		🖊 Functions with persistent state

		🖊 Callbacks and event handlers that remember context
		

💡 Code Example:

	function outer() {
		let counter = 0; // outer function variable

		return function inner() {
			counter++;
			console.log("Counter is now:", counter);
	};
}

const count = outer(); // outer() returns inner()
count(); // Counter is now: 1
count(); // Counter is now: 2
count(); // Counter is now: 3

	
	
	💡 Here, the inner function remembers the counter variable from outer(), even though outer() has finished running.


🧾 Real-World Use Case: Data Privacy


function createBankAccount(initialBalance) {
	
		let balance = initialBalance;

	return {
		deposit(amount) {
			balance += amount;
			return balance;
		},
		withdraw(amount) {
			if (amount > balance) return "Insufficient funds";
				balance -= amount;
				return balance;
		},
			getBalance() {
				return balance;
		}
  };
}

const account = createBankAccount(100);
console.log(account.deposit(50));  // 150
console.log(account.withdraw(20)); // 130
console.log(account.balance);      // undefined (private!)


⚠️ Common Interview Pitfalls

	1. Closures inside loops (classic issue):
	
		for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
			setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000); // prints 3 three times!
		}


✅ Fix using let (block scope):

	for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
		setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000); // prints 0, 1, 2
	}
	

🧠 Common Interview Questions

	💲	What is a closure, and when would you use it?

	💲	How do closures enable private variables?

	💲	Explain how closures can cause memory leaks or unexpected behavior in loops.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

❓ Code in Question:

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000); // prints 3, 3, 3
}


🧠 What’s Going On Here?

	🖊 setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000) is asynchronous — it runs after 1 second, not immediately.

	🖊 var is function-scoped, not block-scoped — all iterations of the loop share the same i.

	🖊 By the time the timeout functions execute, the loop has finished, and i is now 3.

	🖊 Each callback forms a closure that captures the same reference to the variable i.
	

🔍 Where is the Closure?

Every () => console.log(i) is a closure — it closes over the variable i. But they all refer to the same i, which ends up being 3 after the loop completes.

That’s why all three setTimeout callbacks print 3, not 0, 1, 2.

✅ How to Fix It

🔧 Option 1: Use let instead of var

for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  setTimeout(() => console.log(i), 1000); // ✅ prints 0, 1, 2
}

let is block-scoped — each iteration gets its own i, so each closure sees a different value.


🔧 Option 2: Use an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  (function(j) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(j), 1000);
  })(i); // pass i as an argument to freeze its value
}

This creates a new scope for each iteration by passing i as j.


📌 Summary

| Concept              | Behavior                                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `var`                | One shared `i` across all closures                |
| `let`                | New `i` for each iteration                        |
| Closure in this case | The arrow function remembers `i`, but it's shared |


🎯 Interview Takeaway:
"The closures created inside the loop capture the reference to i, not its value at each iteration — and var doesn’t create a new binding per loop step."

🔍 Closure Equivalent in C#

    ✅ Example:
    
         Func<int> CreateCounter()
         {
             int count = 0;
             return () => ++count;
         }
         
         var counter = CreateCounter();
         Console.WriteLine(counter()); // 1
         Console.WriteLine(counter()); // 2
         Console.WriteLine(counter()); // 3
    
    🧠 Explanation:
    
    	The lambda () => ++count closes over the count variable.
    
    	Even though CreateCounter() has finished executing, count is still alive — this is a closure.


📦 Another Example: Closure Inside a Loop (Classic Trap)

    var actions = new List<Action>();

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        actions.Add(() => Console.WriteLine(i));
    }
    
    foreach (var action in actions)
        action();  // ❗ Outputs: 3, 3, 3

🧪 Example: Python Counter using Closure

def create_counter():
    count = 0
    def counter():
        nonlocal count  # allows us to modify 'count' from the outer scope
        count += 1
        return count
    return counter

counter = create_counter()
print(counter())  # 1
print(counter())  # 2
print(counter())  # 3


🔍 Explanation
create_counter() defines a local variable count = 0.

The inner function counter() closes over that variable — it retains access to count even after create_counter() returns.

nonlocal is needed to modify the outer scope variable (count). Without it, Python would treat count as local to counter() and throw an error when you try to assign to it.

🔁 Equivalent with Class



class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0
    def __call__(self):
        self.count += 1
        return self.count

counter = Counter()
print(counter())  # 1
print(counter())  # 2
