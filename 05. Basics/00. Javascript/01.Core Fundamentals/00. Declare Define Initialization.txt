🟩 1. Declaration

Tells the compiler/interpreter that a variable exists.

🔹 Syntax Example:

var x;
let y;
const z; // ❌ SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration


	✅ Characteristics:

		Memory is allocated.

		Variable is known to the system.

		Value is not assigned (it’s undefined unless it's const).



🟨 2. Initialization

Assigning an initial value to the variable for the first time.

🔹 Example:

	x = 10; // Initialization (if x was already declared)


	✅ Characteristics:
	
		Variable gets its first value.

		Can happen at the time of declaration or later.
		
		

🟦 3. Definition (in JavaScript context)

	A combination of declaration and initialization in one step.

🔹 Example:

	let a = 5; // Declaration + Initialization = Definition

⚠️ In other languages (like C/C++), "definition" may imply memory allocation + full specification.



✅ JavaScript Example Recap:

	// Declaration
	var x;      // declared, value is undefined

	// Initialization
	x = 42;     // initialized (assigned a value)

	// Definition
	let y = 10; // declared and initialized (defined)

	| Term               | Description                             | Example      |
	| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------ |
	| **Declaration**    | Introduces the variable name            | `let x;`     |
	| **Initialization** | Assigns the first value to the variable | `x = 5;`     |
	| **Definition**     | Declaration + Initialization together   | `let x = 5;` |
