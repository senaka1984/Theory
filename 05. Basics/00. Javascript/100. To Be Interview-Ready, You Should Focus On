✅ To Be Interview-Ready, You Should Focus On:

1. 💻 Practical Coding Skills

	Practice implementing key topics like:

	Closures

	Event delegation

	Debouncing/throttling

	Promises and async/await

	Prototypes and inheritance

	Use platforms like:

	LeetCode

	Codewars

	Exercism
	
	Frontend Mentor (for UI-focused practice)

2. 🧠 Interview-Specific Concepts

	Include:

	Data Structures & Algorithms (arrays, objects, recursion, sorting, etc.)

	Big-O time complexity

	Problem-solving using JS (e.g., reverse a string, flatten an array)

	Behavioral patterns in JavaScript (Module, Factory, Observer, etc.)

	Difference between deep/shallow copy

3. 🗣️ Explain Concepts Clearly

	Prepare to explain topics out loud, like:

	How hoisting works

	What closures are and real-world use cases

	Why this behaves differently in arrow functions

	Event loop and asynchronous behavior

4. 🛠️ Build Something Real

	Employers love candidates who:

	Can showcase personal projects (GitHub portfolio)

	Have used JS to solve real problems

	Know how to debug, write clean code, and test

🧪 Mock Interview Topics (Frequently Asked)

	What is the difference between == and ===?

	What is a closure? Give an example.

	How does the event loop work in JavaScript?

	What is the difference between null and undefined?

	Explain prototypal inheritance.

	What is the use of bind, call, and apply?

	What are Promises? How is async/await better?

	What are the advantages of using arrow functions?

	How would you debounce an input field?

	How is JavaScript single-threaded yet handles async code?

✅ Summary

	Your topic list is excellent — just make sure you:

		✍️ Code every concept

		🎙️ Explain them aloud

		🤔 Practice interview-style questions

		📁 Build and showcase projects
