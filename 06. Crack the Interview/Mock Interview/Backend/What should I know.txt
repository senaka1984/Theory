For a Senior Backend Developer role, interviewers typically assess a mix of core technical skills, design thinking, code quality, problem solving, and communication. Here's a structured breakdown of common interview areas, especially relevant if you're applying for roles in C#, .NET, or similar stacks.

✅ 1. Software Design Principles
These test your ability to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

SOLID principles (very common)

Design Patterns (e.g., Repository, Factory, Strategy, Singleton, Mediator, CQRS)

Dependency Injection & Inversion of Control

Separation of Concerns / Clean Architecture

DRY, KISS, YAGNI principles

✅ 2. Asynchronous Programming (C#)
Highly important in modern scalable apps:

async/await, Task, Task<T>

Parallelism vs Concurrency

Task.WhenAll, Task.WhenAny

Deadlocks, ConfigureAwait(false)

Fire-and-forget patterns (and risks)

Thread safety, lock, Interlocked, ConcurrentDictionary

✅ 3. API Design & REST Principles
HTTP Methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)

Idempotency, Status Codes

REST vs GraphQL (sometimes asked)

Pagination, filtering, versioning

OpenAPI / Swagger

Secure API design (rate limiting, auth, validation)

✅ 4. .NET Ecosystem / C# Specifics
Memory management / garbage collection

Value types vs reference types

Struct vs class

LINQ (deferred vs immediate execution)

IEnumerable vs IQueryable

Delegates, Func/Action, events

✅ 5. Database Design & Querying
SQL Server / PostgreSQL / other RDBMS

Writing efficient SQL queries (joins, subqueries, window functions)

Indexes, query performance, execution plans

Transactions, ACID properties

EF Core: migrations, tracking vs no-tracking, lazy/eager/explicit loading

Stored procedures (benefits and drawbacks)

✅ 6. Unit Testing & TDD
Writing testable code (interfaces, mocking, DI)

xUnit / NUnit / Moq

Test Pyramid

Code coverage vs test quality

TDD cycles (Red-Green-Refactor)

✅ 7. Security Best Practices
OWASP Top 10 (XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.)

Authentication/Authorization: JWT, OAuth2, IdentityServer, OpenID Connect

Data protection (encryption, hashing, secrets management)

Secure coding practices

✅ 8. DevOps & CI/CD (often expected at senior level)
Git branching strategies (GitFlow, trunk-based)

Build pipelines (Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions, etc.)

Docker, containers, Docker Compose

Deployment strategies (blue-green, canary)

Infrastructure as Code (optional but valued)

✅ 9. Cloud Platforms (especially Azure/AWS)
App Services / Function Apps

SQL Database / Cosmos DB

Queues (Azure Queue, Service Bus, AWS SQS)

Key Vault / Secrets Manager

Application Insights / Logging

Cost/performance tradeoffs in cloud services

✅ 10. System Design / Architecture
Microservices vs monoliths

Synchronous vs asynchronous communication

Messaging queues (RabbitMQ, Azure Service Bus)

Event-driven design

Caching (Redis, in-memory)

Circuit breakers, retries, timeouts

CAP theorem (Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance)

✅ 11. Soft Skills & Behavioral Questions
Decision-making under pressure

Mentoring juniors

Handling technical debt

Dealing with failed deployments

Communicating with non-technical stakeholders

Optional But Bonus Topics:
DDD (Domain Driven Design)

Event Sourcing

CQRS

gRPC

Performance tuning (memory leaks, GC analysis)
