Here's a comprehensive list tailored for DevOps, CI/CD, Azure, and AWS areas—especially useful if you're interviewing for a Senior Backend Developer role with responsibilities in deployment, automation, cloud infrastructure, and environment management.

✅ 1. CI/CD Concepts
What is CI/CD?

Difference between CI, CD (Continuous Delivery), and CD (Deployment)

Benefits: faster releases, early bug detection, automation

Build, Test, Deploy pipelines

Pipeline triggers (push, PR, schedule, manual)

Common tools:

Azure DevOps Pipelines

GitHub Actions

GitLab CI

Jenkins

CircleCI

✅ 2. Git & Source Control
Git branching strategies:

GitFlow

Trunk-based development

Pull Requests (PR) and code reviews

Merging vs Rebase

Handling merge conflicts

Git tagging and versioning for deployments

✅ 3. Azure (Common DevOps Topics)
Azure DevOps

Pipelines (YAML vs Classic)

Environments & deployment gates

Artifact publishing (e.g., .nupkg, Docker images)

Release pipelines and approvals

Azure App Services (Web Apps, API Apps)

Azure Functions (serverless deployments)

Azure Key Vault for secrets management

Azure Blob Storage, Azure Files

Azure SQL setup, firewall rules, elastic pools

Application Insights, Log Analytics

Azure Monitor Alerts

ARM Templates, Bicep, or Terraform (IaC)

Azure Container Registry (ACR)

Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) basics

✅ 4. AWS (Common DevOps Topics)
EC2, S3, RDS, VPC

ECS and EKS for containers

Lambda Functions

API Gateway

IAM Roles & Policies

AWS CodePipeline / CodeBuild / CodeDeploy

CloudFormation (infrastructure as code)

Elastic Beanstalk for web apps

CloudWatch Logs and Metrics

Secrets Manager & Parameter Store

Route53 for DNS

✅ 5. Containers & Orchestration
Docker:

Writing Dockerfiles (multi-stage builds)

Building and pushing images

Volumes, networks, ports

Docker Compose for multi-container apps

Kubernetes (K8s) basics:

Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets

Helm charts (templating K8s manifests)

Health checks, liveness/readiness probes

Horizontal pod autoscaling

Container Registry: Docker Hub, ACR, ECR

✅ 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Terraform (multi-cloud support)

Modules, variables, state files

Provisioning Azure/AWS resources

ARM Templates, Bicep (Azure native)

CloudFormation (AWS native)

Benefits of IaC: reproducibility, auditability, automation

✅ 7. Secrets & Configuration Management
.env files, configuration per environment

KeyVault / Secrets Manager

App Configuration (Azure App Configuration / AWS AppConfig)

Environment variables in containers and cloud apps

Secure handling of secrets in CI/CD pipelines

✅ 8. Logging & Monitoring
Structured logging (Serilog, ELK stack, etc.)

Azure Application Insights / Log Analytics

AWS CloudWatch logs & metrics

Alerts and monitoring rules

Tracing and correlation IDs

Integration with tools like Grafana, Prometheus, DataDog

✅ 9. Security Practices
Least privilege access for users and services

Static code analysis (e.g., SonarQube, CodeQL)

Container scanning (Trivy, Clair)

Secrets scanning (e.g., GitGuardian, Gitleaks)

Penetration testing tools or practices

Securing build pipelines (artifact integrity, secure dependencies)

HTTPS, TLS, Certificates

✅ 10. Deployment Strategies
Blue-Green Deployments

Canary Releases

Rolling updates

Feature flags (LaunchDarkly, Azure App Configuration)

Downtime-less deployments

Rollbacks and disaster recovery

✅ 11. Performance & Cost Optimization
Autoscaling (App Service Plans, EC2 Auto Scaling, K8s HPA)

Resource tagging and budgeting

Spot instances vs reserved instances (AWS)

Azure Cost Management tools

CDN integration (Azure Front Door, CloudFront)

✅ 12. DevOps Culture & Soft Skills
Collaboration with developers & QA

Writing documentation for pipelines & environments

Participating in retrospectives & postmortems

Incident response procedures (runbooks, escalation)

Championing automation and quality gates
