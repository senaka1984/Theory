For a Senior Frontend Developer interview—especially if you're working with JavaScript, React, and JSX—you'll be tested on core web fundamentals, modern JS features, component architecture, performance, testing, and sometimes accessibility and design.

Here’s a structured list of common frontend interview areas:

✅ 1. JavaScript Fundamentals (ES6+)
Scope, Hoisting, Closures

var vs let vs const

Arrow functions vs regular functions

Template literals, destructuring, rest/spread

Promises, async/await

Truthy/falsy, coercion, equality (== vs ===)

this, call, apply, bind

Event loop, microtasks vs macrotasks

Modules: import/export, CommonJS vs ESM

✅ 2. DOM & Browser APIs
DOM manipulation (document.querySelector, etc.)

Event handling & delegation

Bubbling and capturing

localStorage, sessionStorage, cookies

Fetch API and error handling

Debounce vs throttle

Custom events, MutationObserver, IntersectionObserver

✅ 3. React (Core Concepts)
JSX syntax and rules

Functional components vs class components

Hooks:

useState, useEffect, useRef, useMemo, useCallback, useReducer

Props, state, lifting state up

Controlled vs uncontrolled components

Fragment, Portals, Error Boundaries

Refs and accessing DOM

key prop and reconciliation

✅ 4. React (Advanced Topics)
Context API (state sharing across components)

Custom Hooks

Code splitting and lazy loading (React.lazy, Suspense)

Compound components

Render props and higher-order components (HOCs)

Forward refs

useLayoutEffect vs useEffect

✅ 5. State Management
React Context (for simple apps)

Redux: actions, reducers, middleware (redux-thunk, redux-saga)

Zustand, Recoil, or Jotai (if your stack uses them)

Best practices for separating UI and business logic

✅ 6. Routing
React Router DOM

Nested routes

Route parameters

Redirects

Programmatic navigation

useNavigate, useParams, useLocation

✅ 7. Styling & CSS-in-JS
CSS Modules, SCSS

Tailwind CSS (if used in your stack)

Styled Components / Emotion

Responsive design (media queries, flexbox, grid)

BEM naming convention

✅ 8. Forms & Validation
Controlled vs uncontrolled forms

Field validation (custom + libraries like Formik / React Hook Form)

yup schema validation

Error messages and accessibility

✅ 9. Testing
Unit testing: Jest

Component testing: React Testing Library (RTL)

fireEvent, userEvent, mocking APIs

Snapshot testing

E2E testing: Cypress / Playwright (optional but nice)

✅ 10. Performance Optimization
Re-renders and reconciliation

useMemo, useCallback, memoization

React Profiler

Avoiding unnecessary props/state updates

Lazy loading routes/components/images

Virtualization (e.g., react-window, react-virtualized)

✅ 11. Accessibility (a11y)
Semantic HTML

ARIA roles

Keyboard navigation

Screen reader compatibility

Lighthouse / axe-core checks

✅ 12. Build Tools & Dev Environment
Webpack / Vite / Parcel basics

Babel, transpilation

ESLint, Prettier

Source maps, environment variables

Git and version control workflow (rebasing, squashing, PR review)

✅ 13. API Integration
Fetch, Axios

RESTful APIs

Error and loading state handling

Aborting requests

Retry mechanisms

Optional: GraphQL (useQuery, Apollo, caching)

✅ 14. TypeScript (if used)
Interfaces, types, enums

Typing props, state, hooks

Utility types (Partial, Pick, Record, Omit)

Discriminated unions

✅ 15. Soft Skills & Architecture
Component hierarchy design

Reusability and DRY principles

Debugging with DevTools

Collaborating with designers (Figma, Storybook)

Team discussions on tradeoffs (e.g., Context vs Redux)

PR reviews, documentation habits
