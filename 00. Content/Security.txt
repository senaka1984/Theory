Security
========

1. Web Application Security
•	OWASP Top 10:
•	You've already mentioned this, but dive deeper into each category (e.g., Injection, Broken Authentication, Security Misconfiguration).
•	Learn how to mitigate these vulnerabilities in both React and .NET.
•	HTTP Security Headers:
•	Learn about headers like Content-Security-Policy (CSP), Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and Referrer-Policy.
•	Implement these headers in your .NET backend using middleware.
•	Rate Limiting and Throttling:
•	Protect your APIs from abuse by implementing rate limiting using tools like AspNetCoreRateLimit in .NET.

2. Authentication and Authorization
•	JWT (JSON Web Tokens):
•	Understand how to securely generate, validate, and refresh tokens.
•	Learn about token expiration, revocation, and best practices for storing tokens (e.g., HttpOnly cookies vs localStorage).
•	OAuth 2.0:
•	Learn about the different grant types (Authorization Code, Client Credentials, etc.).
•	Implement OAuth 2.0 with third-party providers like Google, Facebook, or GitHub.
•	OpenID Connect (OIDC):
•	Build on OAuth 2.0 to include user authentication.
•	Use libraries like IdentityServer in .NET for implementing OIDC.
•	SSO (Single Sign-On):
•	Understand how SSO works and how to integrate it with your applications.
•	Session Management:
•	Learn about secure session handling, session timeouts, and session fixation attacks.

3. Secure Data Handling
•	Cryptography:
•	Learn about hashing algorithms (e.g., SHA-256, bcrypt) for storing passwords securely.
•	Understand symmetric (e.g., AES) and asymmetric encryption (e.g., RSA).
•	Use .NET's System.Security.Cryptography namespace for cryptographic operations.
•	Data Validation and Sanitization:
•	Validate and sanitize user inputs on both the frontend (React) and backend (.NET) to prevent injection attacks.
•	Secure File Uploads:
•	Validate file types, sizes, and content.
•	Store uploaded files securely to prevent directory traversal or malicious file execution.

4. API Security
•	CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):
•	Understand how to configure CORS policies in .NET to allow or restrict access to your APIs.
•	API Gateway and Reverse Proxy:
•	Use tools like Azure API Management, AWS API Gateway, or NGINX to add an extra layer of security.
•	HMAC (Hash-Based Message Authentication Code):
•	Use HMAC for securing API requests.
•	API Key Management:
•	Learn how to securely generate, store, and validate API keys.

5. Frontend Security (React)
•	XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):
•	Learn about DOM-based, reflected, and stored XSS.
•	Use React's built-in protections (e.g., escaping HTML by default) and libraries like DOMPurify for sanitizing user inputs.
•	CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):
•	Use anti-CSRF tokens in your .NET backend and include them in React requests.
•	Secure State Management:
•	Avoid storing sensitive data (e.g., tokens) in React state or Redux.
•	Secure Dependency Management:
•	Regularly audit your React dependencies using tools like npm audit or Snyk.

6. Secure Deployment
•	HTTPS Everywhere:
•	Use SSL/TLS to encrypt all communication between the client and server.
•	Environment Variables:
•	Store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) in environment variables and never hardcode them.
•	Container Security:
•	If you're using Docker, learn about securing Docker images and containers.
•	Cloud Security:
•	Understand security best practices for cloud providers like Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud.


7. Monitoring and Incident Response
•	Logging and Monitoring:
•	Use tools like Serilog or NLog in .NET for structured logging.
•	Monitor your application using tools like Dynatrace, New Relic, or Azure Monitor.
•	Intrusion Detection:
•	Implement tools like WAF (Web Application Firewall) to detect and block malicious traffic.
•	Error Handling:
•	Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.


8. Secure Database Practices
•	SQL Injection Prevention:
•	Use parameterized queries or ORMs like Entity Framework to prevent SQL injection.
•	Database Encryption:
•	Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
•	Least Privilege Principle:
•	Ensure database users have only the permissions they need.

9. Secure Coding Practices
•	Static Code Analysis:
•	Use tools like SonarQube or Resharper to identify vulnerabilities in your code.
•	Dependency Scanning:
•	Regularly scan your .NET and React dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
•	Code Reviews:
•	Conduct regular code reviews with a focus on security.


10. Learn About Security Standards
•	PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard):
•	If you're handling payments, learn about PCI DSS compliance.
•	GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation):
•	Understand data protection laws and how they apply to your application.
•	ISO 27001:
•	Learn about information security management systems.


11. Tools and Resources
•	Burp Suite:
•	Use this tool for penetration testing and analyzing HTTP(S) requests.
•	OWASP ZAP:
•	Automate security testing for your application.
•	Postman:
•	Test your APIs for security vulnerabilities.
•	Security Blogs and Courses:
•	Follow blogs like Troy Hunt's (creator of Have I Been Pwned).
•	Take courses on platforms like Pluralsight, Udemy, or Coursera.
