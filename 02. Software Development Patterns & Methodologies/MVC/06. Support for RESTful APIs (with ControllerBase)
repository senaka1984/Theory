6. Support for RESTful APIs (with ControllerBase)

•	Use ControllerBase (instead of Controller) for API controllers.
•	Provides features like [ApiController], automatic model validation, and content negotiation.

[ApiController]
[Route("api/[controller]")]
public class ProductsController : ControllerBase
{
    [HttpGet]
    public IEnumerable<Product> Get() => _service.GetAll();
}
