3. Filters (Authorization, Exception, Action, Result)

•	Authorization Filters: Run before anything else to check user permissions.
•	Action Filters: Run before and after action methods (e.g., logging, modifying input/output).
•	Exception Filters: Handle unhandled exceptions globally.
•	Result Filters: Run before and after the action result is executed (e.g., modifying the response).
Example:

[Authorize]
public IActionResult SecureAction() { ... }

public class LogActionFilter : IActionFilter { ... }
