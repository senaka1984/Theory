Key Elements of Scrum
1. Roles
•	Product Owner:
Defines and prioritizes the product backlog, represents the customer, and ensures the team delivers value.
•	Scrum Master:
Facilitates the Scrum process, removes impediments, and helps the team follow Scrum practices.
•	Development Team:
Cross-functional group responsible for delivering potentially shippable increments of the product at the end of each sprint.



2. Artifacts
•	Product Backlog:
An ordered list of all desired work on the project (features, bug fixes, technical work, etc.).
•	Sprint Backlog:
The set of Product Backlog items selected for the current sprint, plus a plan for delivering them.
•	Increment:
The sum of all completed Product Backlog items during a sprint and previous sprints—essentially, the latest working version of the product.


3. Events (Ceremonies)
•	Sprint:
A time-boxed iteration (usually 1–4 weeks) during which a usable product increment is created.
•	Sprint Planning:
Meeting at the start of the sprint to decide what will be delivered and how the work will be achieved.
•	Daily Scrum (Stand-up):
15-minute daily meeting for the team to synchronize activities and plan for the next 24 hours.
•	Sprint Review:
Held at the end of the sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. Stakeholders can provide feedback.
•	Sprint Retrospective:
Meeting after the Sprint Review for the team to reflect on the sprint and identify improvements for the next sprint.

4. Scrum Artifacts Transparency
•	All artifacts should be visible and transparent to all stakeholders to ensure shared understanding and alignment.

Scrum Process Overview
1.	Product Owner maintains the Product Backlog.
2.	At the start of each Sprint, the team selects items from the Product Backlog to work on (Sprint Planning).
3.	The team works on these items during the Sprint, meeting daily (Daily Scrum).
4.	At the end of the Sprint, the team demonstrates the increment (Sprint Review).
5.	The team reflects on the process and identifies improvements (Sprint Retrospective).
6.	The cycle repeats.
