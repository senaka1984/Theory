01. What is Agile

Agile is a software development methodology and a set of principles focused on delivering high-quality software through iterative, incremental development, and collaborative teamwork. Agile emphasizes flexibility, customer feedback, and rapid adaptation to change.

Key Characteristics of Agile:
•	Iterative Development: Work is divided into small, manageable units called iterations or sprints (usually 1–4 weeks).
•	Incremental Delivery: Software is developed and delivered in small increments, allowing for frequent releases and feedback.
•	Collaboration: Close collaboration between cross-functional teams (developers, testers, business stakeholders, and customers).
•	Customer Involvement: Continuous customer feedback is encouraged to ensure the product meets user needs.
•	Embracing Change: Agile welcomes changing requirements, even late in the development process.
•	Continuous Improvement: Teams regularly reflect on their processes and make adjustments for better efficiency and quality.

Popular Agile Frameworks:
•	Scrum: Uses fixed-length sprints, daily stand-ups, and defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team).
•	Kanban: Focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and continuous delivery.
•	Extreme Programming (XP): Emphasizes technical excellence, test-driven development, and frequent releases.

Agile Manifesto (Core Values):
1.	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2.	Working software over comprehensive documentation
3.	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4.	Responding to change over following a plan

Benefits of Agile:
•	Faster delivery of valuable software
•	Improved ability to respond to change
•	Higher product quality through continuous testing and feedback
•	Increased customer satisfaction
