05. Event Sourcing and CQRS Advanced

✅ Difference Between Event Sourcing and CQRS
	Event Sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) are often used together, but they are distinct architectural patterns that serve different purposes. 
	Here’s a breakdown of each, followed by a comparison:

✅ Event Sourcing:
	Event Sourcing is an architectural pattern where state changes are stored as a sequence of immutable events, rather than just the current state of an entity. 
	Every action or state change is captured as an event, and the current state can be reconstructed by replaying those events.

	🔹 Key Characteristics of Event Sourcing:
	
		🧠 Events as the Source of Truth: Instead of storing the current state, events represent every state change in an application.

		🧠 State Rebuilding: The current state of an entity is built by replaying events from the event store, making the history of the application available.

		🧠 Immutability: Once events are written to the event store, they cannot be changed, ensuring an audit trail and historical accuracy.

		🧠 Event Store: A specialized database (or event log) used to store events.

		🧠 Auditability: Since all changes are events, event sourcing naturally provides a full history of system states, useful for auditing and debugging.

	🔹 Benefits of Event Sourcing:
		
		🧠 Provides a full history of state changes.

		🧠 Enables easy rollbacks or state replays for debugging or recovery.

		🧠 Facilitates scalable architectures, especially in event-driven systems.

		🧠 Helps with auditability and compliance, as every state change is tracked.

	🔹 Drawbacks:

		🧠 Eventual consistency: State may not always be immediately up-to-date due to asynchronous processing of events.

		🧠 Complexity: Event sourcing introduces complexity in maintaining event schemas, versioning events, and building projections.

		🧠 Storage growth: The event store can grow indefinitely, requiring mechanisms to handle large amounts of historical data.


✅ CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):

CQRS is a pattern that separates the write operations (commands) from the read operations (queries), allowing each part to be optimized independently.

	🔹 Key Characteristics of CQRS:
		
		🧠 Separation of Command and Query:

		🧠 The command side handles operations that modify the system's state (e.g., Create, Update, Delete).

		🧠 The query side handles operations that read the system's state without modifying it (e.g., Get, List).

		🧠 Independent Models: The command model and the query model are often different, which allows them to be optimized for different purposes. 
			The command model may involve complex business logic, while the query model may be optimized for fast read access (e.g., caching or denormalization).

		🧠 Scalability: By separating reads and writes, CQRS allows independent scaling of the read and write sides.

		🧠 Eventual Consistency: Since updates to the query model are often asynchronous, there can be a period of inconsistency between the write side and the read side.

	🔹 Benefits of CQRS:
		
		🧠 Optimized for Performance: By separating the models for reads and writes, each side can be optimized for its specific requirements.

		🧠 Flexibility in Handling Complex Operations: The command side can handle complex business logic, while the query side can be highly optimized for performance.

		🧠 Scalability: Read and write operations can be scaled independently based on the workload.

		🧠 Security: CQRS allows different permissions for reading and writing, providing more fine-grained security control.

	🔹 Drawbacks:
	
		🧠 Complexity: Implementing CQRS introduces complexity because you must manage two distinct models (read and write), which can increase the development effort.

		🧠 Eventual Consistency: There might be a delay in updating the read model after a write operation, leading to potential temporary inconsistencies.

| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**              | To store the **history of state changes** as events, and reconstruct state by replaying those events. | To **separate** read (query) and write (command) operations, optimizing them independently.                                        |
| **Focus**                | Focuses on how data is **stored** (as events) and how state is **reconstructed** over time.           | Focuses on **separating** the models used for writing (commands) and reading (queries).                                            |
| **State Storage**        | State is **not directly stored**. Only events are stored, and the state is built by replaying events. | Both **write** and **read** models are maintained separately (usually in databases tailored for each).                             |
| **Data Storage**         | Uses an **event store** to persist events.                                                            | Typically uses separate **databases** or models for the read side (optimized for querying) and write side (optimized for updates). |
| **State Reconstruction** | The current state is **reconstructed** by replaying the events.                                       | The state is **maintained separately** for queries and commands, often with eventual consistency.                                  |
| **Event Replay**         | Events are immutable, and you can replay them to rebuild the state at any point in time.              | No direct correlation with event replay. CQRS focuses on optimizing read and write operations independently.                       |
| **Application**          | Used when you need to track **every state change** for auditability, history, or recovery.            | Used when you need to **optimize** the performance of complex systems with heavy read/write requirements.                          |
| **Complexity**           | Can introduce complexity in handling **event versioning** and storing large amounts of event data.    | Can increase complexity by **separating** models and managing eventual consistency between command and query sides.                |


✅  When to Use Event Sourcing and CQRS Together

	Event Sourcing and CQRS are often used together, particularly in systems where:

	The system needs to track a complete history of state changes (Event Sourcing) while also separating the concerns of reading and writing (CQRS).

	There are complex workflows or business logic on the write side that benefit from a command model optimized for updates, while the read side can use denormalized 
	projections for fast query access.

🔹 Example: E-commerce System

	🧠 Event Sourcing:

		Every change in the order lifecycle is captured as an event. For example, OrderPlaced, PaymentReceived, OrderShipped are all events that represent state transitions.

	🧠 CQRS:

		The command side handles operations like placing an order, updating stock, processing payments, etc.

		The query side is optimized for fetching order status, customer order history, or inventory levels quickly and efficiently, possibly using a read-optimized database or 
		caching system.

🔹 Summary:

	🧠 Event Sourcing: Focuses on storing and managing state changes as events, and reconstructing the state of the system by replaying those events.

	🧠 CQRS: Focuses on separating the models for commands (writes) and queries (reads) to optimize them independently.

While both can be used separately, Event Sourcing and CQRS are often paired together to handle complex, event-driven systems with a need for both historical tracking and 
read/write optimization.

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is not exclusively used in Event Sourcing, though they are often used together.

🔹 CQRS and Event Sourcing Relationship:

While CQRS and Event Sourcing are often complementary and can be used together, CQRS can be implemented without Event Sourcing, and Event Sourcing can be used without CQRS. 
Let’s explore both patterns in more detail:

🔹 CQRS (Without Event Sourcing)

		🧠 CQRS focuses on separating the models used for writing (commands) and reading (queries), optimizing them independently for performance and scalability. 
			The read model and write model can be implemented using different storage mechanisms or optimized differently for their respective purposes.

		🧠 Write Side (Command Model): This is where the business logic and state changes happen (e.g., creating or updating records). The write side can use any kind of storage, such as traditional relational databases, document stores, or NoSQL databases, without necessarily relying on event-driven techniques.

		🧠 Read Side (Query Model): This side is optimized for read access. It can be optimized with techniques like caching, denormalization, or even replicated databases.

	Example of CQRS without Event Sourcing:

		🧠 In a traditional CRUD application, you could have a command that updates user information and a separate query that retrieves user data. 
			The write model might be a relational database, while the read model could be a denormalized version of the same data stored in a NoSQL database for faster queries.

		🧠 In this case, you don’t need to store a history of events, nor do you need to reconstruct state from events. 
			CQRS focuses solely on separating reads from writes for performance, scalability, or organizational reasons.

🔹 Event Sourcing (Without CQRS)

		🧠 Event Sourcing focuses on the idea of storing state changes as a sequence of events and rebuilding the state of an entity by replaying those events. 
			It is a data storage and event management pattern and can be implemented independently of CQRS.

		🧠 State Changes as Events: Instead of storing the current state, each action that changes the state (e.g., "OrderPlaced", "PaymentReceived") is recorded as an event.

		🧠 Rebuilding State: To get the current state, you replay all events associated with an entity, such as an order, 
		which can help in systems that need complete traceability or fault tolerance.

🔹 Example of Event Sourcing without CQRS:

	Imagine an application where you track the history of all changes made to an order, such as the OrderPlaced, PaymentReceived, and Shipped events. 
	Here, you don't necessarily separate the command and query operations. You just store events and reconstruct state from them. You could still have a single model (e.g., a traditional CRUD model) for both reads and writes, but state changes are event-driven, and you rebuild state from the event log when needed.

	In this case, Event Sourcing ensures the immutability of the state and provides full traceability, but you don’t have to apply CQRS for managing read/write separation.

🔹 When to Use CQRS with Event Sourcing:

	In many modern systems, CQRS and Event Sourcing are often used together, especially in complex, event-driven architectures. 
	This combination provides several benefits, including:

	Complete History of State Changes: Event sourcing provides an immutable record of all state changes, while CQRS separates the concerns of reading and writing.

	Optimized Read and Write Models: By using CQRS, you can optimize your query models separately (e.g., using denormalized views, caching, etc.) from the command models. 
	Event sourcing ensures that all state changes are captured.

	Scalability: CQRS helps scale read and write operations independently, and Event Sourcing helps with rebuilding the state as needed.

🔹 Example of CQRS with Event Sourcing:

	E-commerce Application:

	Command side: You might have commands like CreateOrder, MakePayment, UpdateInventory that change the state of the system. The commands generate events like OrderCreated, 
	PaymentMade, and InventoryUpdated.

	Query side: You have optimized views (e.g., the current order status) built separately for fast reads, possibly using projections or event listeners to update the read model.

	Events are stored immutably in an event store, and the read model is updated asynchronously by subscribing to these events.

🔹 Summary:

	CQRS can be used without Event Sourcing. It’s primarily about separating the write and read models for performance, scalability, and organization, 
	and does not require event storage or event replay.

	Event Sourcing can be used without CQRS. It focuses on storing state changes as events and rebuilding the state by replaying those events, 
	but it does not mandate separating reads and writes.

	CQRS and Event Sourcing together are commonly used in complex, distributed systems, especially when you need to track every state change (via Event Sourcing) 
	and also optimize reads and writes independently (via CQRS).

	So, CQRS is not restricted to Event Sourcing, but the two are frequently paired together to build scalable, resilient, and maintainable systems in event-driven architectures.
